# RandoWeapon

RandoWeapon is a Pokemon-battle-esque game where character type and weapon vary in damage output and accuracy to play against a string of enemies. The NINJA has high accuracy, but low damage; The TANK has high damage, but low accuracy; The KNIGHT has medium accuracy and medium damage.

The moves include ATTACK, BLOCK, and SWITCH.

ATTACK - deals damage to the enemy. The amount of damage varies with the character type, weapon, and a random number for addition variation.

BLOCK - take less damage. How much damage is absorbed is dependent on a random number between 0.4 and 0.75, which is multiplied with the damage taken.

SWITCH - swap out current weapon with a random one. Each weapon has its own individual probability of rolling. Some are better than others.
